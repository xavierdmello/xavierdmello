## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Xavier D'Mello!
Welcome to my Github! I'm an avid tech enthusiast, student, and developer with >7 years of programming experience.

### A little bit about me... âœ¨
Inspired by my family & love for video games, I made my first text-based RPG in C++ when I was 11. Ever since then, I've had a deep-rooted interest in all things STEM, going on to make android apps, tinker with hardware like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and model with Blender, before finally settling on my current passion for blockchain apps & machine learning. Currently, I'm completing my BSc in Computer Science at Laurier <img src="flag-canada.png" width="21" height="21"/>
